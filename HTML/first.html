<h2>Who is a Frontend Developer? </h2>
<hr>
<p>A Front-End Developer is a software developer who builds the user-facing part of a website or application—everything that users see, interact with, and experience directly in their browser or app.</p>

<p>A Front-End Developer is responsible for building the user-facing part of a website or application by converting UI/UX designs into functional web pages. Their key responsibilities include creating user interfaces such as layouts, navigation menus, buttons, and forms, while also ensuring a smooth user experience by making the site easy to use, responsive, and fast.
     They focus on cross-device compatibility so that websites work well on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices, and they optimize performance to improve loading times and interactions. To achieve this, front-end developers use core technologies like HTML for structuring web pages, CSS for styling elements including colors, fonts, and layouts, and JavaScript for adding interactivity such as animations, dropdowns, and dynamic content. 
     They also work with modern frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, and Vue.js, manage code with version control tools such as Git and GitHub, and rely on development tools like VS Code, Chrome DevTools, and build systems like Webpack or Vite. For example, when you open a website like Amazon, all the visible elements—the search bar, buttons, product cards, and shopping cart icon—are created by a front-end developer, while the back-end developer manages the logic behind processing orders and storing data in the database.</p>
