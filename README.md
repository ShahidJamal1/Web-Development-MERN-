🎯 Goal

My goal is to become a Full Stack MERN Developer by:

Practicing daily

Writing clean & structured code

Building real-world mini projects

Strengthening fundamentals before moving to React & Backend

Following a step-by-step learning approach

⚙️ JavaScript Core Concepts (Lecture 3 – Stack & Heap Memory)

In Lecture 3, I learned how JavaScript manages memory using Stack and Heap, which is essential for understanding how data is stored and accessed during program execution.

🔹 Topics Covered
✅ Stack Memory

Used for primitive data types

Number

String

Boolean

Null

Undefined

BigInt

Symbol

Key Characteristics:

Stores a copy of the value

Fast access

Fixed memory size

Changes do not affect the original variable

📌 Example: When assigning one primitive variable to another, a copy is created.

✅ Heap Memory

Used for non-primitive (reference) data types

Objects

Arrays

Functions

Key Characteristics:

Stores data as a reference

Multiple variables can point to the same memory

Changes reflect in all references

📌 Example: When copying an object, both variables refer to the same memory location.

✅ Stack vs Heap (Core Difference)
Stack	Heap
Stores primitive values	Stores reference values
Copy is created	Reference is shared
Faster access	Slightly slower
Fixed size	Dynamic size

📂 Location:
JavaScript/Lec 3/

✅ Outcome (After Lecture 3)

Strong understanding of JavaScript memory management

Clear difference between primitive vs reference types

Better debugging skills

🧮 JavaScript Operators (Lecture 4 – Assignment Operators)

In Lecture 4, I learned how to use assignment operators in JavaScript to assign and update values stored in variables efficiently.

Assignment operators are essential for writing clean, readable, and optimized code.

🔹 Topics Covered
✅ Basic Assignment Operator

= → Assigns a value to a variable

let x = 10;

✅ Compound Assignment Operators

Used to perform operations and assign the result in a shorter way.

+= → Addition assignment

-= → Subtraction assignment

*= → Multiplication assignment

/= → Division assignment

%= → Modulus assignment

📌 Example:

let x = 10;
x += 5;   // x becomes 15
x *= 2;   // x becomes 30

✅ Why Assignment Operators Matter

- Reduce code length

- Improve readability

- Make updates to variables faster

- Follow professional coding practices

📂 Location:
JavaScript/Lec 4/

✅ Outcome (After Lecture 4)

Clear understanding of assignment operators

Ability to write shorter and cleaner JavaScript code

Stronger foundation for logical operations

Better preparation for control statements and problem-solving

Foundation for advanced topics like closures and execution context
